# Welcome to My ToDo List Code Notes

## 02/12/2022

Today I am starting on the todo list. The hardest part is how to structure my files. I could go simple and have only five components or I could have each module for each task.

Resources:

- [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture)
- [Implementing Dark Mode in your React App with SCSS](https://dev.to/cmcwebcode40/simple-react-dark-mode-with-scss-lae)
- [Creating Add/Remove Effects for list items](https://dev.to/cmcwebcode40/simple-react-dark-mode-with-scss-lae)

Just found out today that Node Sass has been deprecated. I got an error "Cannot find module sass". Thank you Stack Overflow!
