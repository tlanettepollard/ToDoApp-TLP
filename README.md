## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

I have include six screen shots of three devices:

- Nokia N9 (480x854)
- iPad (768x1024)
- MacBook Air (1440x900)

I used the Responsively app while coding. They have a great screen-shot function. I also used Photoscape app to edit and combine the screen shots.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Sass - still one of my favorites to use.

### What I learned

I'm still a novice when it comes to working with React. In fact, I started this project before I worked on my React Nanodegree with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). Many of my notes focus on learning and reviewing key concepts I had learned through [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). While working on my Todo App, I learned:

- About making a unique ToDo task using name and adding props to the ToDoList Component. New-- used localeStorage for getting and holding task data. I was having a hard time figuring out how to import my sample tasks.
- That useState() creates a piece of state for a component, and its only parameter determines the initial value of that state. It returns two things: the state, and a function that can be used to update the state later.
- How to use an object spread syntax to create a new object and toggle checked property before returning it.
- About using an Array.prototype.filter() to test and exclude a task from the new array if the id prop matches the id parameter passed into the deleteTask();
- About how React deals with events and handles state, and implemented functionality to add tasks, delete tasks, and toggle tasks as completed.

The section that I was most proud about was my **ThemeContent.jsx** and **\_themes.scss**. This was my first time building a React app with light and dark theme.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```React
import React from 'react';

export const initialThemeState = {
    theme: 'light',
    setTheme: () => null
};

const ThemeContext = React.createContext(initialThemeState);
export default ThemeContext;
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
	console.log('ðŸŽ‰');
};
```
